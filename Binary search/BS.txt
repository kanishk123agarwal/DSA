binary search is based on three types of problem 
1) general binary search question 
2) predicate and search space problem 
3) index based problem it is less but it's also very important -- it is based on because index is in sorted manner so it is also good 

general question on binary search is based on mid number or general approach 
EX nearly sorted array 
pivot index


predicate and search space basically lie on the search space 
find sqrt(x);
divident/divisor

index based basically 
oddoccuring of element
